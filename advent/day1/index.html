<h1>Day 1: Forth</h1>
<h3>Language introduction</h3>
<p>
Forth is a pretty interesting language. It's called a concatenative / stack based language. What this means is that operators or functions will pick up what's currently on the stack as argument to manipulate.
Let's try a session to see:
</p>
<pre>
$ gforth
Gforth 0.7.3, Copyright (C) 1995-2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

<span class="comment">\ let's enter some numbers !</span>  ok
1 2 3  ok
<span class="comment">\ our stack now contains [1, 2, 3]. We can see the full contents with .s </span> ok
.s <3> 1 2 3  ok
+  ok
.s <2> 1 5  ok
. 5  ok
.s <1> 1  ok
+
:9: Stack underflow
>>>+<<<
Backtrace:
</pre>
<p>
After each input, the interpreter will answer ok if everything went right.<br /><br />
Numbers are put on the top of the stack. <br />
<code> \ </code> starts a comment.<br />
<code>+</code> will add the two items on the top of the stack and put the result back on it.<br />
<code>.</code> will pop and output the top item of the stack.
</p>
<p>
As the stack is essential to this language, there's a lot of operation to affect its content.
<ul>
  <li><code>DUP</code>: duplicates the top element of the stack.</li>
  <li><code>SWAP</code>: swaps the top two elements of the stack.</li>
  <li><code>ROT</code>: rotates the top three elements of the stack.</li>
  <li><code>DROP</code>: drops the top element from the stack.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We can also define new words with <code>: NAME ...DEFINITION ;</code>
For instance
<pre>
: DOUBLE 2 * ;  ok
3  ok
DOUBLE  ok
. 6  ok
</pre>
</p>

Let's try to make our own multiplication, using the loops the language provide us.
The classic for loop can be done using the <code>?DO ...DEFINITION LOOP</code> <sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>.
Here's our solution:
<pre>
<span class="comment">\ Let's assume we want to multiply 5 and 3, so we start with [3, 5]</span>
: MULT <span class="comment">\ [3, 5]</span>

  <span class="comment">\ used to store the result</span>
  0 <span class="comment">\ [3, 5, 0]</span>

  <span class="comment">\ backward rotation</span>
  -ROT <span class="comment">\ [0, 3, 5]</span>

  <span class="comment">\ we loop from 0 to 5</span>
  0 ?DO <span class="comment">\ [0, 3]</span>

  <span class="comment">\ duplicate then rotate</span>
  DUP ROT <span class="comment">\ [3, 0, 3]</span>

  + <span class="comment">\ [3, 3]</span>

  <span class="comment">\ Here the top item is the result and the last is the operand, so we need to swap them</span>
  <span class="comment">\ (I forgot about this one on the first try)</span>

  SWAP
  <span class="comment">\ we need to drop the operand after the loop so our stack</span>
  <span class="comment">\ has replaced the two operands with the result</span>
  LOOP DROP
  ;
</pre>

<p>
So yeah, even a simple case like this turns out to be pretty complicated. Maybe my implementation could be
a bit simplet but it works at least. 
</p>
<p>Ok, now we should be ready to try and solve day 1!
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
The first day is pretty simple, as usual: our input is a list of numbers and we need to find two of those whose sum is 2020 and multiple the two.
For example:
<pre>
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
</pre>
In this list, we have 
<code>1721 + 299 = 2020</code>
so the answer is 
<code>1721 × 299 = 514579</code>.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for us, the puzzle input is a list of number so it's a valid forth program.
For the first part, we're gonna do a pretty dirty solution. The INCLUDED word allows us to dynamiccaly include another forth program file so we will be able to loop through our list of numbers and try if any following number makes the correct sum.
</p>

<p>
We cannot do loops inside of word definition, there's a difference between word that can be used at compile time and words that can be used at runtime.
So let's define a first method:
</p>
<pre>

: SOLVE

  <span class="comment">\ we could properly calculate the number of items</span>
  <span class="comment">\ but a big enough number will do the trick.</span>
  <span class="comment">\ this will loop backward from 0 to 300.</span>
  300 0 ?DO

  <span class="comment">\ s" is a word to define a string (which will be ended by ")</span>
  S" data.fs" INCLUDED 

  <span class="comment">\ I is a magic word that will contain the index of the current loop.</span>
  <span class="comment">\ Here we want to loop from 0 to I and drop elements</span>
  I 0 ?DO DROP LOOP

  <span class="comment">\ we can then call find-number with the stack properly prepared.</span>
  FIND-NUMBER
  LOOP
  ;
</pre>

<p>
Now we're gonna use a new concept because trying to make a complicated function like this with only the main stack seems way to hard: the return stack.
This is a special stack that can be used inside a function. It needs to be emptied at the end of execution, for some reason.
<pre>

: FIND-NUMBER
  <span class="comment">\ this move the top of the main stack to the return stack</span>
  >r 

  <span class="comment">\ start an undefinite loop, its end will be decided by the UNTIL keyword</span>
  BEGIN

    <span class="comment">\ we need to duplicate the top item</span>
    <span class="comment">\ we'll need it for the multiplication if it sums to 2020 with the other candidate</span>
    DUP

    <span class="comment">\ duplicate the top item on the return stack into the stack</span>
    R@

    <span class="comment">\ = puts -1 (true) if the two top items are equal, 0 (false) otherwise</span>
    + 2020 =

    <span class="comment">\ an if statement !</span>
    <span class="comment">\ It looks at the stop of the stack and executes the next instructions</span>
    <span class="comment">\ until the ELSE or THEN keyword</span>
    IF

    <span class="comment">\ If the condtion is true, we are done here</span>
    <span class="comment">\ We show the multiplication, and line break and stop the execution</span>
    R@ * . CR BYE 

    <span class="comment">\ otherwise we drop that item</span>
    ELSE DROP

    <span class="comment">\ then is actually the end of the if statement in that language</span>
    THEN

    <span class="comment">\ we keep that loop while there is some items in the stack</span>
    depth 0=
  UNTIL

  <span class="comment">\ manual garbage collection</span>
  <span class="comment">\ we put the item on the return stack back to the main stack and then drop it</span>
  r> DROP
  ;
</pre>
<p>
Ok let's try it:
</p>
<pre>
$ gforth part1.fs
1013211
</pre>
<p>
Correct answer, Let's move on to part 2!
</p>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>
In the second part, we now need to find three numbers that add up to 2020 and show the result of their multiplication.

For this one, I tried to keep with only the stack and the return stack but this was way too hard a task. Apparently, Forth internally uses the return stack for loop indexes so I can't mix using a numbered loop and the return stack in a function. <br /> <br />So we're gonna use variables to solve this one. To declare a variable, we use the  <code>VARIABLE</code> word. <br />Then, to put the top of the stack to the variable we need to do <code>VARIABLENAME !</code> and to push the variables value to the top of the stack we do <code>VARIABLENAME @</code>.
</p>
<pre>
VARIABLE INDEX1
VARIABLE INDEX2
VARIABLE VALUE1
VARIABLE VALUE2
VARIABLE NBITEMS

: CALC-NBITEMS
  S" data.fs" INCLUDED
  depth NBITEMS !
  NBITEMS @ 0 DO DROP LOOP
  ;

CALC-NBITEMS
</pre>
<p>
We actually need the number of items in our list this time. So we dynamically include the file, store the depth of the stack into a variable and then empty the stack.
</p>
<pre>

: SOLVE

  0 INDEX1 !
  0 INDEX2 !

  BEGIN
    S" data.fs" INCLUDED

    <span class="comment">\ we drop index1 numbers</span>
    INDEX1 @ 0 ?DO DROP LOOP 

    <span class="comment">\ set the top of the stack to value1</span>
    VALUE1 !

    <span class="comment">\ drop index2 numbers</span>
    INDEX2 @ 0 ?DO DROP LOOP

    <span class="comment">\ set the top of the stack to value2</span>
    VALUE2 !

    <span class="comment">\ nested loop that will test the remaining stack item forming a correct triplet</span>
    BEGIN
      <span class="comment">\ duplicates the top of the stack in case it's the correct one</span>
      DUP
      VALUE1 @
      VALUE2 @
      + +
      2020 =
      <span class="comment">\ if it's true then we have found the solution</span>
      IF VALUE1 @ VALUE2 @ * * . CR BYE

      <span class="comment">\ otherwise drop the duplicated item</span>
      ELSE DROP THEN depth 0=
    UNTIL

    <span class="comment">\ pretty much INDEX2++</span>
    INDEX2 @ 1+ INDEX2 !

    <span class="comment">\ we test if index1 + index2 + 2 = NBITEMS</span>
    <span class="comment">\ indeed, we drop index1 + index2 items and pop two</span>
    <span class="comment"> \ for value1 and value2 se so we need more than NBITEMS + 2</span>
    INDEX1 @ INDEX2 @  + 2 + NBITEMS @ =
    IF

    <span class="comment">\ in this case we set index2 to 0 and increments index1</span>
    0 INDEX2 !  INDEX1 @ 1+ INDEX1 !
    THEN
    <span class="comment">\ infinite loop ;</span>
    0 UNTIL ;

SOLVE

<pre>
$ gforth part2.fs
13891280
</pre>
<p>
Ok, This works!
</p>
<p>
Using variables, part2 was actually way simpler that part1, kind of defeating the purpose of the language... <br /> <br />
Maybe I'm just not used to it but stack manipulation does seem really mindbending.<br /><br />
What I did like about this language it does not look like there's a lot of special citizens, most of the things are just simple words. <br />
If you type something, the language will try and see if it knows this word and otherwise try and fallback to a number.
For instance, here we are remapping 3 to 4. Forth will recognize 3 as a word and interpret it as 4.  <sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<pre>
: 3 4 ;  ok
1 3 + . 5  ok
</pre>

<p>
Operators are not something special, they're just words which happen to be character. For instance, let's define <code>**</code> as exponentiation:
</p>
<pre>
<span class="comment">/ This is pretty much the same code as MULT but the operator is * and the starting element is 1</span>
: **
  1 -ROT 0 ?DO DUP ROT * SWAP LOOP DROP ; ok
2 30 ** . 1073741824  ok
</pre>
<p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
  <li id="note1">
  <a href="#ref1">^</a>
  The <code>DO</code> keyword also exists but it's a bit tricky: it will behave rather unexpectedly if both the indexes are the same:

  <blockquote class="m">
          Here is something to beware of: suppose the initial indices for the <code>DO</code> loop are equal:
         that is, something like<br /><br />

         <code>17  17  DO   stuff   LOOP</code><br /><br />

         then the loop will be executed <code>2<sup>32</sup>-1</code> times! As the ANS Standard document says,
         “This is intolerable.” Therefore ANS Forth defines a special word, <code>?DO</code>,  that will skip
         the loop if the indices are equal, and execute it if they are not.

  This made me think my <code>MULT</code> implementation was wrong and I spent like 15 minutes before realizing I had cursed my repl. With great power...
